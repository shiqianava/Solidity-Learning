/* 
Error
An error will undo all changes made to the state during a transaction.
You can throw an error by calling require, revert or assert.
1. require is used to validate inputs and conditions before execution.
2. revert is similar to require. See the code below for details.
3. assert is used to check for code that should never be false. Failing assertion probably means that there is bug.
